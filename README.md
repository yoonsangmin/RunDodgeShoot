## ðŸ‘‰Implementations

*âœ” Player Control: I made an enum that represents player's status and I implemented their behavior in the update function using switch statement.
    *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerControl.cs  


*âœ” Level Control: I implemented level control class to parse text file and set level values.
    *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/LevelControl/LevelControl.cs  
 
 
*âœ” Stage Creator: I implemented stage creator that creates map and object contantly with level data.
 *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/GameRoot/StageCreator.cs  
 
 
*âœ” Sound Manager: Sound manager is a singleton class that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. It can load sound resources during running time and loaded resources can reuse.
    *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Sound/SoundManager.cs  


*âœ” Object Pool: I implemented object pool to prevent allocation and freeing memory and reuse preallocated object instances. Bullets, blocks, enemies and etc. are created by class that inherit object pool.
    *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/ObjectPooling  


*âœ” Save Manager: Save manager can save and load ranking data and volume of sound using Json.
    *Code Location: https://github.com/yoonsangmin/RunDodgeShoot/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Save/SaveManager.cs
